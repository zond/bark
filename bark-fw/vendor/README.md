## lora-phy

The SX1262 driver, copied from https://github.com/lora-rs/lora-rs, directory
`lora-phy`, at revision `7a9c2ec4f6f926cae053ea8f7095dcf77e5d4185` (2026-10-06).
Licensed MIT or Apache-2.0, at the user's choice; both licence texts are in the
directory.

It is a copy, not a git dependency, because the firmware needs a change the
library does not offer (roadmap D20). Changes from the upstream revision:

- `Cargo.toml`: `lora-modulation` and `lorawan-device`, which upstream takes from
  sibling directories, come from the same git revision.

To move to a newer upstream revision: replace the directory with that revision's
`lora-phy`, reapply the changes listed here, and review the upstream diff as for
any driver update.
